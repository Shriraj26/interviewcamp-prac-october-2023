If there are n nodes in a graph, there can be at most n-1 edges from node A to 
node B. This is due to the fact that the number of vertices will always be greater
than the number of edges, and also if you add n edges between nodes A and B,
then you leave one node behind unconnected!!


There can be no shortest path in a graph between 2 nodes if there is 
a negative cycle. IT means that if you keep on adding all the edges
in a cycle from say NOde A to B, and if you keep on getting negative weights,
Then the sum of weights will aleays decrease, leading to -ve infinity
Thus there is no minimum path or shortest path when there is a negative cycle
in 2 nodes.
